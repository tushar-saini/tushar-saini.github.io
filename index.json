Balancing the right amount of inventory is crucial, as over-planning can lead to capital, labor, and space being tied up, along with an increased risk of wastage, particularly for products with limited shelf life. On the other hand, under-planning may result in stock-outs and significant sales losses. Achieving this balance is essential. One approach to tackle this is adopting a demand-driven approach to replenishment planning. To forecast demand, various factors such as historical trends, festivals, seasons, promotions, and more can be taken into account. However, discussing the intricacies of demand forecasting is beyond the scope of this topic, and warrants a dedicated article of its own.\nIn this article, we will explore replenishment planning, which encompasses methods for optimizing inventory levels across different levels of the supply chain. The primary objective is to ensure that each level maintains sufficient stock to meet the demands of its downstream counterparts and that with minimal cost.\nOnce we have the end node demand of products, we can start out to find the best optimal solution which minimizes the transportation costs, reduce inventory days, reduce stocks-out. However, finding the optimal solution involves considering several constraints. These constraints include factors such as the available types of trucks between nodes, the weight and volume capacity of trucks, warehouse capacities, and the optimal path between nodes (especially in cases where overlapping regional warehouses can fulfill the demand).\nSolution Given these constraints, there can be numerous permutations and combinations that satisfy the conditions. However, identifying the best optimal solution is a challenging task due to the large number of possibilities. It often requires sophisticated optimization techniques and algorithms to evaluate and select the most efficient configuration that minimizes costs, optimizes inventory levels, and ensures timely order fulfillment.\nIn our use case, we employed mixed-integer linear programming to address the optimization challenge. This programming paradigm involves formulating an objective function, which can be either a cost function to minimize or a reward function to maximize, along with a set of constraints. The solver then seeks the optimal solution that satisfies these constraints while optimizing the objective function. Mixed-integer linear programming allows for both continuous and discrete decision variables, enabling us to model real-world scenarios with binary or integer requirements.\nWe used gurobi solver wrapped in a python script and deployed as a microservice on server. The solver consumed various inputs such including product demand at end nodes, box volume and weight, warehouse capacities, available truck types between nodes, cost of each truck type per kilometer, distances between nodes, truck capacities, and other relevant factors. By leveraging this comprehensive set of inputs, we generated an optimal replenishment allocation plan and transport plan at each node.\n","date":1656685800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656685800,"objectID":"33498f51a6be7053cd4cefd07d2367e3","permalink":"https://tushar-saini.github.io/post/replenishment-planning/","publishdate":"2022-07-01T20:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/post/replenishment-planning/","section":"post","summary":"Replenishment Planning to find optimal transport planner which minimizes the transportation costs, reduce inventory days, reduce stocks-out","tags":[],"title":"Replenishment Planning","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Problem Statement In today’s digital age, e-commerce companies are constantly seeking ways to gain an edge over their competitors. With customers expecting faster and more convenient services, companies are offering increasingly attractive options. One such offering is one-day or same-day delivery. While these services are certainly attractive to customers, they put enormous strains on their delivery partners.\nMany small e-commerce players rely on third-party aggregators to handle their logistics operations. These companies establish a Service Level Agreement (SLA) that defines certain Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). When these KPIs are unmet, penalty is levied by merchants. As a result, companies make every effort to avoid breaching their terms of SLAs.\nIn a warehouse, one such KPIs is total order cycle time, i.e., the average time it takes for an order to get shipped, starting from the moment when the order is received. Once an order is placed at a merchant site, a corresponding request is generated in a warehouse where it goes through multiple stages. The order needs to be located and picked from its rack, which is usually done in batches to save time. However, this raises multiple “what if” scenarios. For example, what if some customers have overlapping products? What if only one order was placed? What if we have multiple items that are of different categories and require different packaging? These complexities are generally handled by the warehouse manager, by maintaining Standard Operating Procedures. After the order is picked, it needs to be sorted, packaged, and prepared for courier pickup. These processes require human effort, and the manager needs to manage resources at each stage based on the order flow.\nAlthough future order flow can be estimated by analyzing historical data and resources can be planned based on these forecast, but there can still be unexpected events that can compromise the entire process. So it is of utmost importance to have tools that can help manage warehouse resource planning in advance. The solution should be able to simulate all possible scenarios and generate resource allocation plan. It should also be able to keep up with the physical changes and changes in SOPs, for example if an improvement is made in the warehouse to reduce pick up time, it should reflect in the system.\n   Warehouse process. Picture generated by Dalle  Solution Due to the presence of multiple random factors that are connected to various uncertain events a deterministic solution would not suffice. These uncertainties introduce a level of complexity that makes it challenging to predict whether the Service Level Agreement (SLA) will be achieved or breached. To tackle this, a modeling approach known as Monte Carlo simulation can be utilized.\nMonte Carlo simulation is a technique that involves running numerous iterations of a model by randomly sampling input values from the probability distributions. In the context of our digital twin, Monte Carlo simulation can help generate a range of possible outcomes for meeting SLAs by considering the variability and uncertainty in factors such as order flow, time taken by workers to complete each task, variability in operational hours, and other relevant variables. Our ultimate goal is to achieve SLAs even in worst case scenarios.\nOther application of the tool is to simulate What if? scenarios. What if we have X number of resources and Y number of order, how should we distribute these X at each assembly to minimize order cycle time? What if we have very large Y orders, how many resources we need to acheive SLAs? Various permutations and combinations can be input to the model and based on these inputs other dependent variables can be calculated to maximize or minimize any specific metrics.\nMethodology Just like in any problem within the data science field, the initial step involves curating and vetting the data in our system. Ensuring the quality and reliability of the data is crucial for accurate analysis and modeling. After the data is vetted, we explored it from various angles. Specifically, for analyzing the historical order pattern, we examined factors such as the frequency of orders based on the day of the week, week of the month, holiday season, and product type. This analysis guided our selection of features for modeling the probability density distribution.\nWhile opting for a Gaussian Distribution may simplify the process, it is not always the most suitable estimator. In our case, we found that a Gaussian Distribution was not a good fit for our data. Consequently, we employed Kernel Density Estimate, a non-parametric method for estimating the probability distribution function. This approach allowed us to capture the underlying probability distribution accurately.\nA similar approach could be used to estimate other random factors, like the time taken by resources to pick up specific types of orders, sort multi-batch orders, pack different kinds of items, …","date":1643725800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643725800,"objectID":"9cc0d6ff64e919a5e89591e0a3c7003a","permalink":"https://tushar-saini.github.io/post/digital-twin/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T20:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/post/digital-twin/","section":"post","summary":"A digital twin solution for representing warehouse's outbound process to simulate multiple what if? scenarios to formulate efficient resource planner.","tags":[],"title":"Digital Twin For Warehouse Resource Planning","type":"post"},{"authors":["Tushar Saini","Pratik Chaturvedi","Varun Dutt"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1639069422,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639069422,"objectID":"94fef498758bf8277cde4e8a8c4b3bb5","permalink":"https://tushar-saini.github.io/publication/frontiers-2021/","publishdate":"2022-06-21T22:33:42+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/frontiers-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Air quality is a major problem in the world, having severe health implications. Long-term exposure to poor air quality causes pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. Several studies have also found that deteriorating air quality also causes substantial economic losses. Thus, techniques that can forecast air quality with higher accuracy may help reduce health and economic consequences. Prior research has utilized state-of-the-art artificial neural network and recurrent neural network models for forecasting air quality. However, a comprehensive investigation of different architectures of recurrent neural network, especially LSTMs and ensemble techniques, has been less explored. Also, there have been less explorations of long-term air quality forecasts via these methods exists. This research proposes the development and calibration of recurrent neural network models and their ensemble, which can forecast air quality in terms of PM2.5 concentration 6 hours ahead in time. For forecasting air quality, a vanilla-LSTM, a stack-LSTM, a bidirectional-LSTM, a CNN-LSTM, and an ensemble of individual LSTM models were trained on the UCI Machine Learning Beijing dataset. Data were split into two parts, where 80% of data were used for training the models, while the remaining 20% were used for validating the models. For comparative analysis, four regression losses were calculated, namely root mean squared error, mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error and Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results revealed that among all models, the ensemble model performed the best in predicting the PM2.5 concentrations. Furthermore, the ensemble model outperformed other models reported in literature by a long margin. Among the individual models, the bidirectional-LSTM performed the best. We highlight the implications of this research on long-term forecasting of air quality via recurrent and ensemble techniques.","tags":[],"title":"Modelling Particulate Matter Using Multivariate and Multistep Recurrent Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tushar Saini","D.C.

Five individual time-series forecasting models, namely, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) were developed. Also, a new weighted ensemble model of these individual models was developed. Among the individual models, results revealed that both during training and test, the CNN performed the best, and this model was followed by the LSTM, MLP, and SARIMA models.

Although offline air-quality monitoring using hand-held devices is common, online air-quality monitoring is still expensive and uncommon, especially in developing countries. The primary objective of this paper is to propose an online low-cost air-quality monitoring, prediction, and warning system (AQMPWS) which monitors, predicts, and warns about air-quality in real-time. The AQMPWS monitors and predict seven pollutants, namely, PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Ozone and Sulphur Dioxide. In addition, the AQMPWS monitors and predicts five weather variables, namely, Temperature, Pressure, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, and Wind Direction. The AQMPWS has its sensors connected to two microcontrollers in a Master-Slave configuration. The slave sends the data to the API in the cloud through an HTTP GET request via a GSM Module. A python-based web-application interacts with the API for visualization, prediction, and warning. Results show that the AQMPWS monitor different pollutants and weather variables within range specified by pollution control board. In addition, the AQMPWS predict the value of the pollutants and weather variables for the next 30-min given the current values of these pollutants and weather variables using an ensemble model containing a multilayer-perceptron and long short-term memory model. The AQMPWS is also able to warn stakeholders when any of the seven pollutants breach pre-defined thresholds. We discuss the implications of using AQMPWS for air-quality monitoring in the real-world.
