Long-term exposure to poor air quality causes pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. Several studies have also found that deteriorating air quality also causes substantial economic losses. Thus, techniques that can forecast air quality with higher accuracy may help reduce health and economic consequences. Prior research has utilized state-of-the-art artificial neural network and recurrent neural network models for forecasting air quality. However, a comprehensive investigation of different architectures of recurrent neural network, especially LSTMs and ensemble techniques, has been less explored. Also, there have been less explorations of long-term air quality forecasts via these methods exists. This research proposes the development and calibration of recurrent neural network models and their ensemble, which can forecast air quality in terms of PM2.5 concentration 6¬†hours ahead in time. For forecasting air quality, a vanilla-LSTM, a stack-LSTM, a bidirectional-LSTM, a CNN-LSTM, and an ensemble of individual LSTM models were trained on the UCI Machine Learning Beijing dataset. Data were split into two parts, where 80% of data were used for training the models, while the remaining 20% were used for validating the models. For comparative analysis, four regression losses were calculated, namely root mean squared error, mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error and Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient. Results revealed that among all models, the ensemble model performed the best in predicting the PM2.5 concentrations. Furthermore, the ensemble model outperformed other models reported in literature by a long margin. Among the individual models, the bidirectional-LSTM performed the best. We highlight the implications of this research on long-term forecasting of air quality via recurrent and ensemble techniques.","tags":[],"title":"Modelling Particulate Matter Using Multivariate and Multistep Recurrent Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tushar Saini","D.C.

Recording of air pollution via real-time low-cost IoT-based monitoring systems and its subsequent forecasting are likely to help timely warn people about prevailing air pollution across a large number of sites. In this paper, we propose and compare a real-time low-cost IoT-based air pollution monitoring system against an existing, accurate, and expensive industry-grade system. Furthermore, we undertake the task of predicting the accurate values of the industry-grade system from values recorded by the low-cost system. For forecasting, a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, a Vector Autoregressive Moving Average (VARMA) model, a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous variable (SARIMAX) model, and a weighted ensemble model of VAR, VARMA, and SARIMAX models were trained and tested on particular matter data. Data for forecasting were collected from the low-cost monitoring system and the industry-grade system over a period of time. Results revealed that the low-cost monitoring system predicted the values of the industry-grade system accurately. Furthermore, the ensemble model performed the best among all models in forecasting of accurate particular matter values of the industry-grade system by using the output of the low-cost system.

A number of time-series forecasting models have been developed to predict air-pollution. However, an evaluation of individual and ensemble models for real-time air pollution forecasting lacks in the literature. The primary objective of this research is to develop and test individual and ensemble time-series forecasting models for real-time forecasting of air pollution ahead in time. Air pollution data of suspended particulate matter (PM2.5) over 5-years from Beijing, China was used for model comparisons. The PM2.5-time-series was split as the first 80% for training and the latter 20% for testing time-series forecasting models. Five individual time-series forecasting models, namely, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) were developed. Also, a new weighted ensemble model of these individual models was developed. Among the individual models, results revealed that both during training and test, the CNN performed the best, and this model was followed by the LSTM, MLP, and SARIMA models. Furthermore, the weighted ensemble model performed the best among all models. We highlight the potential of using the weighted ensemble approach for real-time forecasting of suspended particulate matter.","tags":[],"title":"A Weighted Ensemble Approach to Real-Time Prediction of Suspended Particulate Matter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tushar Saini, MS in CS","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Although offline air-quality monitoring using hand-held devices is common, online air-quality monitoring is still expensive and uncommon, especially in developing countries. The primary objective of this paper is to propose an online low-cost air-quality monitoring, prediction, and warning system (AQMPWS) which monitors, predicts, and warns about air-quality in real-time. The AQMPWS monitors and predict seven pollutants, namely, PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Ozone and Sulphur Dioxide. In addition, the AQMPWS monitors and predicts five weather variables, namely, Temperature, Pressure, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, and Wind Direction. The AQMPWS has its sensors connected to two microcontrollers in a Master-Slave configuration. The slave sends the data to the API in the cloud through an HTTP GET request via a GSM Module. A python-based web-application interacts with the API for visualization, prediction, and warning. Results show that the AQMPWS monitor different pollutants and weather variables within range specified by pollution control board. In addition, the AQMPWS predict the value of the pollutants and weather variables for the next 30-min given the current values of these pollutants and weather variables using an ensemble model containing a multilayer-perceptron and long short-term memory model. The AQMPWS is also able to warn stakeholders when any of the seven pollutants breach pre-defined thresholds. We discuss the implications of using AQMPWS for air-quality monitoring in the real-world.
